## Event Overview
**Pulling back the curtain: exploring the inner workings of genomics workflows in public health** \
*October 21-22, 2025 ~ Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, Bureau of Laboratories ~ Lansing, MI*

The Midwest AMD Symposium is an annual, in-person training event for public health bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, laboratorians, administrative personnel, and associated partners and collaborators affiliated with AMD activities across the Midwest public health workforce region. Through a combination of educational presentations, group discussions, case studies, and interactive workshops, participants attend this event to learn about emerging AMD topics, become inspired with ideas to implement in their organizations, and connect with experts and colleagues across the Midwest region and beyond. The 4th-annual Midwest AMD Symposium explored the inner workings of genomics workflows in public health with the theme of "pulling back the curtain".
