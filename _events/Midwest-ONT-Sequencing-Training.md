## Training Overview
*April 2-3, 2025 ~ Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, Bureau of Laboratories ~ Lansing, MI*

The Midwest Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Sequencing Training was an in-person training for Midwest lab and sequencing personnel interested in learning about ONT sequencing or long-read sequencing, in general. Through a combination of hands-on wet bench training, educational presentations, and group discussions, this event aimed for trainnees to be able to leverage long-read sequencing technologies to bolster genomic surveillance and outbreak investigation in their jurisdictions.
