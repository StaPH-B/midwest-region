title: nf-core for Standardized and Reproducible Nextflow Pipeline Development
description: An introduction to the nf-core framework for bioinformaticians with Nextflow experience
training_number: 2
---

The goal of this lesson is to teach bioinformaticians with a basic understanding of Nextflow the fundamentals of the nf-core framework for pipeline development. Nextflow is a workflow management language used to develop bioinformatics pipelines, and the nf-core framework is a system for creating standardized, reproducible, and portable Nextflow pipelines. Students will learn the principles and benefits of using the nf-core framework, how to use nf-core pipelines, and how to create a simple, custom nf-core pipeline.

**Note**: This lesson will mostly focus on the fundamentals of the nf-core framework and will only give a brief review of Nextflow fundamentals. Some Nextflow experience is highly recommended.
