The Midwest Genomic Epidemiology Training Series (MGETS) consists of four virtual webinars presented by genomic epidemiology expert and manager of the Genomic Analysis Unit at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), Dr. Arianna Miles-Jay, MPH, PhD.

These sessions are recorded webinars presented live in 2024. Approximate run time for each session = 30-40min

## Session 1 - Molecular Microbiology
This session introduces genomic epidemiology and covers key topics in molecular microbiology such as defining a genome, understanding why microbial genomes shed light on microbial spread, how features of a genome can influence their connection to spread, and how genomes are used to help identify concerning infections.
