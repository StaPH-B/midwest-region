### Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene

#### Senior Genomics and Data Scientist

Kelsey Florek

#### Bioinformatics Regional Resource

Christopher Jossart, also known as C.J., is a data scientist in the Communicable Disease Division at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. He holds an MPH from the Yale School of Public Health and completed a year-long bioinformatics fellowship with the Association of Public Health Laboratories at WSLH. C.J. specializes in bioinformatic workflow development, onboarding and validating new pipelines, and submitting data to public databases

#### Bioinformatics Training Lead

Abigail C Shockey, PhD (they/them)

Dr. Abigail Shockey is a data scientist in the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene's Communicable Disease Division. They received their postdoctoral degree in Microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and they completed a post-doctoral bioinformatics fellowship from the Association of Public Health Laboratories at WSLH. Dr. Shockey’s work is focused on outbreak investigation using genomic data, bioinformatic workflow development, and bioinformatic training development. They are also a certified Carpentries instructor and develop Carpentries style workshops.

### Michigan Department of Health & Human Services

#### Genomic Analysis Unit Manager

Dr. Arianna Miles-Jay is the Genomic Analysis Unit Manager at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Laboratories, where she leads a team of bioinformaticians and genomic epidemiologists that process and analyze pathogen genomic data to support infectious disease prevention and response efforts in Michigan. She earned her MPH and PhD in Epidemiology at The University of Washington followed by a postdoctoral fellowship focused on the genomic epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections at The University of Michigan. Broadly speaking, Arianna is interested in expanding the implementation of genomic epidemiology within state and local public health through developing sustainable and flexible systems to analyze pathogen sequence data, as well as through teaching the current and future workforce about the power of genomic epidemiology to improve public health. 

#### Bioinformatics Training Lead

Macy E. Pell, PhD (she/her)

Macy is the AMD Training Lead and Analyst for the Genomics Section at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services – Bureau of Laboratories. She obtained her PhD in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics from Michigan State University where she received extensive training in genomic sequencing, analysis, and interpretation of infectious diseases. As a seasoned science communicator, Macy focuses on curating and facilitating training resources and events for the public health workforce affiliated with advanced molecular detection efforts (i.e., sequencing, bioinformatics, and genomic epidemiology) in the Midwest region.
