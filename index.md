### Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene

#### Senior Genomics and Data Scientist

Kelsey Florek

#### Bioinformatics Regional Resource

CJ Jossert

#### Bioinformatics Training Lead

Abigail C Shockey, PhD

Dr. Abigail Shockey is a data scientist in the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene's Communicable Disease Division. They received their postdoctoral degree in Microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and they completed a two-year post-doctoral bioinformatics fellowship from the Association of Public Health Laboratories at WSLH. They are a certified Carpentries instructor, and develop Carpentries style workshops. Dr. Shockeyâ€™s work is focused on bioinformatic workflow development, bioinformatic training development, and outbreak investigation using genomic data.

### Michigan Department of Health & Human Services

#### Genomic Analysis Unit Manager

Dr. Arianna Miles-Jay is the Genomic Analysis Unit Manager at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Laboratories, where she leads a team of bioinformaticians and genomic epidemiologists that process and analyze pathogen genomic data to support infectious disease prevention and response efforts in Michigan. She earned her MPH and PhD in Epidemiology at The University of Washington followed by a postdoctoral fellowship focused on the genomic epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections at The University of Michigan. Broadly speaking, Arianna is interested in expanding the implementation of genomic epidemiology within state and local public health through developing sustainable and flexible systems to analyze pathogen sequence data, as well as through teaching the current and future workforce about the power of genomic epidemiology to improve public health.
