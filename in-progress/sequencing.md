## Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) explained
NGS is an umbrella term for modern DNA sequencing technologies. NGS sequencing technologies can rapidly sequence DNA in parallel, and they are faster and more cost effective than the first generation of sequencing 
technologies that preceded them.

### What’s the difference between NGS and whole genome sequencing (WGS)? 
Some people use the acronyms NGS and WGS interchangably, but there are important differencesWGS is the process of sequencing all of an organism’s genetic material i.e. its chromosome and plasmids. Not all sequencing is 
WGS. For example, using a method commonly referred to as targeted amplicon sequencing, we can use NGS to sequence only specific parts of the genome we’re interested in, such as virulence or antibiotic resistance genes.

#### In summary: NGS is a technology, WGS is a technique, and we can use NGS to perform WGS.
